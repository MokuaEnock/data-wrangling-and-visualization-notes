00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,304
Real quick before we jump into design techniques,

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,029
it's important to discuss the purpose of visualizations.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,639
Visualizations can be used for two main purposes when analyzing

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,605
data Exploratory analysis and Explanatory analysis.

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,455
Exploratory analysis is done behind the scenes.

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,159
This is the type of analysis where you're searching for

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,085
relationships in the data or hidden insights.

8
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,769
Once you've collected the data,

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,379
you can start asking questions about it.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,740
The way you analyze data to try and answer these questions is known as exploratory.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,240
Visualizations built for these purposes,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,323
do not need to be perfect.

13
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:43,664
You're simply looking for patterns.

14
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:48,554
Explanatory analysis is done after you find an insight.

15
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:52,170
Visualizations for these purposes need to be surrounded by

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,840
a story that points the reader to an insight that answers the question.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,330
Many times these explanatory visuals were found during the exploratory process.

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,129
But rather than share every step and piece of data that led to this

19
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,774
visualization,you ask the question and then

20
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:17,160
focus on answering the question with a visualization that supports your finding.

21
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,265
There are five steps in the data analysis process.

22
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,905
First, you extract your data.

23
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:26,085
You might get the data from a survey,

24
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:29,894
a database, the web or some other source.

25
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:32,780
Then you can clean the data.

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,254
As a part of this process,

27
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,405
you might fix missing values,

28
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:40,049
determine which columns to keep, round values,

29
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,375
or perform some other tricks to get the data in a way that you can analyze it.

30
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,224
The next step is exploring your data.

31
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:51,194
The visuals used for cleaning, exploring,

32
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:56,519
and analyzing your data are part of the exploratory data analysis process.

33
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,129
The visuals created here and even during

34
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:04,125
the cleaning phase don't need to be super pretty or super clear in their message.

35
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:09,389
They're just for you, the analyst to determine what is going on in the data.

36
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,979
Once you explore the data,

37
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,474
you might determine a particular analysis that was best to answer a particular question.

38
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,150
Maybe you are predicting sales,

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,640
or fraud, or home prices,

40
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,419
when you find an insight to share the visuals used

41
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,639
for sharing this insight or part of the explanatory visuals.

42
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,609
These visuals tell the story of the finding and what it means.

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,140
They motivate the actions and move your audience forward.

44
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,299
The role of this lesson is to build visuals that will be used for explanatory analysis.
