Hi there. I'm Mike.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,460
I'm Josh.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,910
We would like to welcome you to this course on data visualization.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,100
Data visualization is vital in multiple areas of the data analysis process.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,725
Two main topics are covered in this course.

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,590
Exploratory data visualizations are used to understand

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,580
the structure of your data faster than statistics would be able to load.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,160
This type of visualization is used once you are

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,980
ready to start investigating your gathered data.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,460
Explanatory data visualizations, on the other hand,

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,800
are created at the end of your analysis.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,825
This type of visualization is used to convey your findings to others or to tell a story.

13
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:47,345
This course will go over more than just how to code to create your visualizations.

14
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:50,870
You'll also learn about the design of visualizations from

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,595
choosing the right plot type to selecting appropriate variable encoding.

16
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:58,145
You will learn to create visualizations that are clear not just for you,

17
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,065
but also for others.

18
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:05,435
Data visualization is probably my favorite part of the data analysis process.

19
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:10,190
It is always exciting to observe visualizations that generate new insights.

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,810
By going through this course,

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,220
you'll be able to use data visualization techniques to enhance your data analysis work.
