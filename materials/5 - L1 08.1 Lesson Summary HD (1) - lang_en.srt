00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,030
Welcome to the end of the first lesson.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,315
In this lesson, you saw an example of why data visualization,

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,405
it's so important to the data analysis process.

4
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,090
You also learned about the primary libraries that will

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,595
be introduced in later lessons - Pandas,

6
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,010
Seaborn, and Matplotlib - and how they

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,675
compliment each other in the visualization process.

8
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,050
In the next lesson,

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,510
you will learn more about the design aspects of your visualizations.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,090
Further lessons will see you building visualizations for

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,440
both exploratory and explanatory analyses. See you in the next lesson.
