00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
In the previous quiz,

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,230
you were introduced to four data sets of X,

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,070
Y pairs and you found that they all share the same mean and standard deviation.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,490
So you might think that the points are very similar to one another.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,379
It turns out, the mean,

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,570
the variance, the correlation,

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,304
and the line of best fit are all exactly the same for these four data sets.

8
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:26,109
But how similar are these data sets really?

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,119
It turns out, not very.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,105
This is something called Anscombe's quartet and

11
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:35,159
demonstrates how important it is to always plot your data.

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,504
It is important that you pick out visual patterns, trends,

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,765
and outliers during your analysis,

14
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:44,969
as relying on only summary statistics can be misleading.

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,390
Below is a link to Alberto Cairo's DataSaurus which

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,530
shows another example which is even crazier than this example.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,715
He uses the same idea but he finds a star,

18
00:00:55,715 --> 00:01:00,270
a circle, and a data source that all share the same summary statistic.
