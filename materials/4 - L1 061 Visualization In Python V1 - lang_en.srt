1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,480
In this course, you will make use of two Python Visualization Libraries.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,775
Matplotlib and Seaboard.

3
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,660
You will also make use of plotting functions built into the pandas library,

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,835
which is a general data analysis package not explicitly just for data visualization.

5
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:23,670
Often, when choosing a tool to work with,

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,895
there's a trade-off between flexibility and productivity.

7
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:30,975
On one end, you have a tool that has a high amount of flexibility.

8
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,830
Matplotlib falls on this end of the spectrum.

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,140
The versatility of Matplotlib,

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,145
allows it to be used for nearly any kind of visualization you care to create.

11
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:43,385
But this versatility, can come with a lot of verbosity.

12
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:46,490
There are some common plots like bar charts,

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,370
that require a large amount of code to be written.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,390
The fact that you sometimes need to be very specific about how plots are

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,385
created can make it hard to quickly explore your data with matplotlib alone.

16
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:00,545
If you're looking to be productive,

17
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:03,980
and need to be generating many plots with little code,

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,370
Libraries like seaborne and Pandas can come in handy.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,230
These libraries contain a lot of

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,030
convenience functions to quickly generate plots of your data.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,585
However, the plot types afforded by these libraries are not exhaustive.

22
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:21,290
So on their own, they're not as flexible as matplotlib.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,055
Together, the strengths of these libraries are complementary.

24
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,620
For the most part, you can expect to use Pandas and

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,935
Seaboard to perform initial explorations of your data.

26
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:34,820
You may then want to use matplotlib to customize your plots,

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,880
or generate plots not covered by these other libraries.
