# Exploratory vs Explanatory Analysis.

1. Exploratory analysis is done when you are searching for insights. These visualizations don't need to be perfect. You are using plots to find insights, but they don't need to be aesthetically appealing. You are the consumer of these plots, and you need to be able to find the answer to your questions from these plots.

2. Explanatory analysis is done when you are providing your results for others. These visualizations need to provide you the emphasis necessary to convey your message. They should be accurate, insightful, and visually appealing.

The five steps of the data analysis process:

- Extract - Obtain the data from a spreadsheet, SQL, the web, etc.
- Clean - Here, we could use exploratory visuals.
- Explore - Here, we use exploratory visuals.
- Analyze - Here, we might use either exploratory or explanatory   visuals.
- Share - Here is where explanatory visuals live.
