# Python Data Visualization Libraries

In this course, you will make use of the following libraries for creating data visualizations:

- Matplotlib: a versatile library for visualizations, but it can take some coding effort to put together common visualizations.
- Seaborn: built on top of matplotlib, adds a number of functions to make common statistical visualizations easier to generate.
- pandas: while this library includes some convenient methods for visualizing data that hook into matplotlib, we'll mainly use it for its main purpose as a general tool for working with data.
  
All together, these libraries will allow you to visualize data in a balance of productivity and flexibility for both exploratory and explanatory analyses.
