# Common terms

From Wikipedia, **Chart junk** refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph or that distract the viewer from this information.

Examples of chart junk you saw in this video include:

- Heavy grid lines
- Unnecessary text
- Pictures surrounding the visual
- Shading or 3d components
- Ornamented chart axes

The **data-ink ratio**, credited to Edward Tufte, is directly related to the idea of chart junk. The more of the ink in your visual that is related to conveying the message in the data, the better.

## Design Integrity Notes

It is key that when you build plots you maintain integrity for the underlying data.

One of the main ways discussed here for looking at data integrity was with the lie factor. Lie factor depicts the degree to which a visualization distorts or misrepresents the data values being plotted.
​

lie factor= (Δvisual/visual*start*)/(Δdata/data*start*)

​## Color

Color can both help and hurt a data visualization. Three tips for using color effectively.

Before adding color to a visualization, start with black and white.

When using color, use less intense colors - not all the colors of the rainbow, which is the default in many software applications.

Color for communication. Use color to highlight your message and separate groups of interest. Don't add color just to have color in your visualization.
